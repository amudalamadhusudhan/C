# C

**DAY2:Data types and operators**
1. Develop a C program to perform operations (+,*,-, / and %) on two whole numbers. Identify suitable data types to represent the numbers and resultant values
2. Write a program to demonstrate bitwise operators
3. Develop a C program to add two operands and store the result in one of the operand using addition assignment operator.( a+=b is same as a=a+b)
4. Write a C program to find the maximum of 2 numbers using Conditional operator.
5. A C program contains the following declarations and initial assignments: 

int  i= 8, j = 5; 
float  x = 0.005,  y = 0.01; 
char c = ‘c’, d = ‘d’; 
Determine the value of each of the following expressions. 
(3*i*j)%(2*d) 
(i*j)%(c+2*d) / (x*y) 
5 * (i + j) > 'c' 
2*x+ (y== 0) 
(x > y) && (i > 0) || (j < 5)

    Take radius “r” as input.
7. Develop a C program to calculate simple interest using the formula I=PTR/100.

**Day4 Assignments**
Functions
1. Write a swap function to perform the swap operation.
2. Write a program to find the GCD of two numbers.
Take two integers as input, find the GCD and return it to main.
3. Write a program to print the prime Fibonacci numbers in a given range.
4. Take the range of numbers as input and print all the prime Fibonacci numbers as output. Use Functions. Try with non-recursive and recursive functions.

5. Write a program to reverse an integer number.
Use recursion.

6. Write a recursive function to find factorial of a number. 

7. Write a function to swap contents of two variables using functions 

**Day5 Assignments**
 Arrays

2.  Write a C program to count the frequency of each number in a 1-D array.
All the elements in the array are integers.
3. Write a C Program to display one dimensional array elements with addresses
4. Write a C Program to Find Greatest Element in Array in one dimensional array 
5. Write a C Program to Reversing the 1-D Array Elements 
6. Write a C Program to sort elements in 1-D Array
7. Write a program to remove the duplicate elements in an integer array.
8.  Write a C Program to display two-dimensional array elements with addresses
9. Write a C program to copy the elements of one 2-D array to another 2-D array.
10.  Write a C program to sum two 2-D matrices
11.  Write a C program to print the transpose and inverse matrices of a given matrix.
12. Write a C Program to display three-dimensional array elements with addresses

Day6 Assignments
 Pointers
1. Write a C program that declares and initializes (to any value you like) a char, an int, a double and a float. Your program should then print the address of, and value stored in, each of the variables. 
Use the format string "%u" [%p in hex] to print the addresses as unsigned integers. 
Hint: You can use the character “&” to find addresses.

2. Write a C program to declare an integer and an integer pointer to it. Initialize the integer variable. Print the value of the int variable using pointer variable.
Hint: You can use dereferencing operator *.
