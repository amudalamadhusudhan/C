assignments

**DAY2:Data types and operators**
1. Develop a C program to perform operations (+,*,-, / and %) on two whole numbers. Identify suitable data types to represent the numbers and resultant values
2. Write a program to demonstrate bitwise operators
3. Develop a C program to add two operands and store the result in one of the operand using addition assignment operator.( a+=b is same as a=a+b)
4. Write a C program to find the maximum of 2 numbers using Conditional operator.
5. A C program contains the following declarations and initial assignments: 

int  i= 8, j = 5; 
float  x = 0.005,  y = 0.01; 
char c = ‘c’, d = ‘d’; 
Determine the value of each of the following expressions. 
(3*i*j)%(2*d) 
(i*j)%(c+2*d) / (x*y) 
5 * (i + j) > 'c' 
2*x+ (y== 0) 
(x > y) && (i > 0) || (j < 5) 
6.  Write a program to find the area and the perimeter of a circle. 
    Take radius “r” as input.
7. Develop a C program to calculate simple interest using the formula I=PTR/100.
